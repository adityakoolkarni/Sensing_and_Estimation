# Semantic Classifier

In this project pixel color classifier is modeled as a binary classification problem primarily to identify red color pixel in the images to detect objects of interest like stop sign. Then a bounding box is fitted around them to detect the stop signs from other regions of the image which might be red but not necessarily red.
